# Terra - Final degree project for Computer Engineering

This project consists of the complete development of a web platform using the latest state-of-
the-art technologies. The platform will allow different organizations to create challenges and
competitions related to sustainable actions, which players will be able to complete to gain points
and compete in different leaderboards. The use of gamification will create more engagement from
the users. Examples of those actions are recycling, cleaning the environment (beach, mountain,
etc), or self-development challenges, such as exercising every day. The completion of those will
grant users points through which they will level up and gain achievements. Administrators of
the platform will control the registering of organizations and challenges. Challenges would be
both public (open to the world) and private (created for organizations for their own members).
The possibility of allowing rewarding will be studied, along with techniques of verification for
challenges that need them.
